HOPS - Highly Optimized Pythonic Structures
============================================

This project's goal is to build a collection of efficient and practical data structures (in C),
and then wrap'em up using Cython to obtain lightning-speed data structures at the Python level.
I am now taking my first glance at the Cython docs and the wrapping process looks promisingly easy.

Most of the C code is currently derived by the VIS GLU library (licensing issues not clear here,
but I think the package should be more or less under a BSD-like license. My goal would be to 
place everything under LGPL so if needed, I will end up rewriting my own implementation of 
non-LGPL compatible pieces of code.

The library should be equipped with a complete test suite covering both the C and Python interfaces.

A reasonable set of data structures would be:

1. AVL self-balancing trees (done)
2. Dynamic Arrays 
3. Hash tables
4. Lists, Stacks and Queues
5. Priority Queues
6. Graphs (both Directed and Undirected)

Future structures

7. BDDs
8. ... who knows?

All of those structures should be fully available both at the C level
and, most importantly, at the Python level.
